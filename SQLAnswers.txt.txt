select TrackId from Tracks where Milliseconds > 5000000
Select CustomerID,FirstName,LastName,State,Company from Customers where State IN('RJ', 'DF', 'AB', 'BC', 'CA', 'WA', 'NY')
select  Name from Tracks where Name Like ('All%')
Select CustomerId,Email from Customers where Email Like('J%gmail.com')
Select InvoiceId,BillingCity,Total from Invoices where BillingCity IN('Brasília','Edmonton','Vancouver') Order By InvoiceId Desc 

Find the albums with 12 or more tracks.
Select AlbumId from Albums where Title>=12 group by albumid

Show the number of orders placed by each customer (hint: this is found in the invoices table) and sort the result by the number of orders in descending order.
select customerId,invoiceid from invoices group by customerID order by invoiceid desc

For Question 8: 

SELECT CustomerID, COUNT (*) AS num

FROM Invoices

GROUP BY CustomerID

Order By num DESC;

The total number of orders I am getting for the 8th person on the list is 7, is that correct? 

Question 9: 

SELECT AlbumID, COUNT (*) AS num

FROM Tracks

GROUP BY AlbumID




For question 8, you can validate the number of orders you are getting by running a separate simple query to check the number of rows returned where customerID = xx. The number of rows returned should match your order count for that customerID. 

For question 9, the WHERE clause can only be used with SELECT statements, and the HAVING clause with the GROUP BY statement.

after a count, you need having instead of where

The error in question 9 is that you should write the where clause like.. Where num >12 because the integers are not written in quotes.


SELECT

InvoiceId

,COUNT(CustomerId) AS Tc

/*,InvoiceDate

,BillingAddress

,BillingCity

,BillingState

,BillingCountry

,BillingPostalCode

,Total*/

FROM Invoices

GROUP BY CustomerId

ORDER BY InvoiceId DESC ; 



SELECT CustomerID, 

count(InvoiceId) 

FROM Invoices 

GROUP BY CustomerID 

ORDER BY count(InvoiceId) desc;

select count(*) as NumAlbumsWith12OrmoreTracks

from (

select count(distinct trackId) as C, albumID from tracks

group by albumId

having C >=12)




Where num > '12';
